  <h1>AgriX — Revolutionizing Agriculture</h1>
  <p>
    AgriX is a compact, AI-powered platform built at American International University-Bangladesh (Summer 24-25) that combines satellite imagery, machine learning disease detection, bilingual NLP support, and a farmer-to-buyer digital marketplace to help Bangladeshi farmers plan crops, diagnose problems early, and sell produce directly — practical tech for real rural impact. This project was completed by <strong>Group - 3</strong> as a Software Engineering submission (Course Outcomes: CO3, CO4).
